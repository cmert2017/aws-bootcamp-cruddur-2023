--Homework Challanges--  
1- Learned how to install Docker on my local machine and got the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces  
Note: I had here several challanges: First: in my local, frontend-flask didnt run and after debugging I saw that npm install directory was not correct and after updating it, I delete my docker in docker dashboard and then rerun the docker compose up, it worked. As seen below.

 Then after debugging, I noticed that URL's were not correct for localhost and I changed them as seen below.

 Then this time it didnt show the icons. After debugging I founf that loaddata was missing. After adding it finally it worked.
