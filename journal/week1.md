--Homework Challanges--
1- Learned how to install Docker on my local machine and got the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces  
Note: I had here several challanges: First: in my local, frontenflask didnt run and after debugging I saw that npm install directory was not correct and after updating it, I delete my docker in docker dashboard and then rerun the docker compose up, I it worked. As seen below.
